## Overview

Try out generative AI models right in your browser for free using this playground! ‚ú®

Using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) and [Ollama](https://ollama.com), you'll be able to run SLMs (*Small Language Models)* such as [Phi-3](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct) directly in your browser, without having to install anything.
 
## Usage

This project is designed to be opened in GitHub Codespaces, which provides you a pre-configured environment to run the code and AI models. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Select the "Open in GitHub Codespaces" button: [![Open project in GitHub Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/Codespaces-Open-blue?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://codespaces.new/sinedied/ollama-javascript-playground?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main)
2. Once the Codespace is loaded, it should have [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) pre-installed as well as the [OpenAI Node SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-node).
3. Ask Ollama to run the SLM of your choice. For example, to run the [Phi-3](https://ollama.com/library/phi3) model:

    ```bash
    ollama run phi3
    ```

    That will take a few seconds to download the model.
4. Once you see "success" in the output, you can send a message to that model from the prompt.

    ```shell
    >>> Write a haiku about hungry hippos
    ```
5. After several seconds, you should see a response stream in from the model.
